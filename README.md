# weatherpy

This repository contains python scripts to visualize the weather of 500+ cites across the world and focuses on the Python library Citipy, the Open Weather Map API, MatPlotLib, Pandas, and Jupyter Notebooks.

## Background

The Python code in this repository randomly selects 500+ cities across the world, uses a series of succesive API calls, prints a log of each city as it's being processed (with the city number and city name), saves all data in a CSV, and creates scatter plots showing relationships between: 

* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

Also included in the repository is a written description of theree observable trends based on the data.
